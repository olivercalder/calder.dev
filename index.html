<h1>Oliver Calder</h1>

<p>
I am an open source software developer based in Minneapolis.
I work on the snapd team at <a href=https://canonical.com>Canonical</a>, the company which creates <a href=https://ubuntu.com>Ubuntu</a>.
A big focus of my work has been on the snapd backend for <a href=https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-desktop-s-24-10-dev-cycle-part-5-introducing-permissions-prompting/47963>AppArmor Prompting</a>, which is a new layer of user-defined security on top of the existing system of <a href=https://snapcraft.io/docs/interfaces>snap interfaces</a>.
I am also a semi-recent graduate from Carleton College, where I studied mathematics and computer science.
</p>

<p>You can reach me through various media.</p>

<p>
I am an avid Linux user and a proponent of open-source software and first-principles problem solving.
My language of choice is Rust, but most of my professional work is in Go.
My academic background is primarily in C and Python, with an emphasis on systems programming.
I have developed an interest in computability theory, and I enjoy trying to solve problems in unconventional ways, such as using Prolog, minimal assembly languages, and Turing machines.
</p>

<p>
I am very passionate about classical music, and I love going to performances at the <a href=https://thespco.org>St. Paul Chamber Orchestra</a>, the <a href=https://minnesotaorchestra.org>Minnesota Orchestra</a>, the <a href=https://mnopera.org>Minnesota Opera</a>, and various theatres around the Twin Cities.
I am a clarinetist and pianist and an alumnus of the Greater Twin Cities Youth Symphonies (<a href=https://www.gtcys.org>GTCYS</a>).
I'm always looking for more opportunities to make music, particularly chamber music and folk music, so feel free to reach out with any ideas.
</p>

<p>
I care strongly about reducing climate change and living as sustainably as possible (in the U.S., for now).
I can often be spotted rolling around on my very large dutch bicycle, which is my primary means of transportation around the Twin Cities.
I seek out dense, walkable, mixed-use communities supported by reliable public transportation, and I support local businesses whenever I can.
</p>

<p>
I believe in digital privacy and freedom from surveillance-capitalist corporations, and believe open source and open standards are essential to a better digital world for everyone.
I'll probably be writing some blog posts/tutorials on the matter soon, but in the meantime, here are some of the tools and services I use to improve my own digital independence:
<ul>
	<li><b><a href=https://duckduckgo.com>DuckDuckGo</a>:</b> privacy-respecting search engine which doesn't sell your searches to advertizers or fill your results page with ads and AI-generated nonsense (and with better search results, in my experience).</li>
	<li><b><a href=https://duckduckgo.com/email>DuckDuckGo Email Protection</a>:</b> generate single-use email addresses which block trackers before forwarding emails onto your primary email address (which should be ProtonMail -- see below).</li>
	<li><b><a href=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/>Firefox</a>:</b> open source, privacy-respecting web browser which isn't doing all the horrible anti-consumer, tracking, and monopolistic practices that Chrome is being increasingly flagrant about.</li>
	<li><b>Privacy-focused browser extensions:</b> <a href=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin>uBlock Origin</a> (ad blocker), <a href=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-for-firefox>DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials</a>, and <a href=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17>Privacy Badger</a>.</li>
	<li><b><a href=https://proton.me>Protonmail</a>:</b> privacy-respecting email (and files, calendar, and password manager) service hosted in Switzerland, which powers <a href=mailto:oliver@calder.dev>oliver@calder.dev</a>, and provides <a href=https://proton.me/easyswitch>great resources for switching from Gmail</a>.</li>
	<li><b><a href=https://www.signal.org>Signal</a>:</b> open source and end-to-end encrypted messaging, voice, and video calling application which I use on all my devices (all the nice message features of iMessage, without the not nice walled garden).</li>
	<li><b><a href=https://nextcloud.com>Nextcloud</a>:</b> open source, fully-featured, and (optionally) self-hosted replacement for Google Drive, Photos, Calendar, Contacts, and more.</li>
	<li><b><a href=https://ubuntu.com>Ubuntu</a>:</b> Linux has come a very long way in a few short years, and these days it's more visually consistent and far easier to install and update applications than either MacOS or Windows -- I happen to use Ubuntu at the moment, but Fedora is great too.
	<li><b><a href=https://joinmastodon.org>Mastodon</a>:</b> open source and algorithm-free social media platform.</li>
	<li><b><a href=https://bitwarden.com>BitWarden</a>:</b> everyone should be using a password manager and generating random passwords (e.g. <code>S*CrtUj@@*&amp;4SmQSbdrmUW&amp;%^SVC^CSJ</code>) for each account, and BitWarden is an open source one which is easy to use and runs on basically everything (including excellent browser and Android integration).</li>
</ul>
