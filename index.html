<h1>Oliver Calder</h1>

<p>
I am a firmware engineer, an open source software developer, and a recent graduate from Carleton College, where I studied mathematics and computer science.
My academic interests also include linguistics, and I really enjoy the intersection between these three areas, in particular the encoding, modification, and expression of information through various means, from natural language to cryptography.
</p>

<p>
I am an avid Linux user and a proponent of open-source software and first-principles problem solving.
My languages of choice are Rust, C, and Python, though I can often be found tweaking shell scripts.
I have developed an interest in computability theory, and I enjoy trying to solve problems in unconventional ways, such as using Prolog, minimal assembly languages, and Turing machines.
</p>

<p>
I am passionate about classical music.
I am a clarinetist and pianist and an alumn of the Greater Twin Cities Youth Symphonies (<a href=https://www.gtcys.org>GTCYS</a>).
I also enjoy climbing, cycling, and reading, and I believe strongly in sustainable communities, transportation, and development.
