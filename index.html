<h1>Oliver Calder</h1>
<p>This website belongs to Oliver Calder. Hello! Thank you for visiting.</p>

<p>I am a firmware engineer, and a recent graduate from Carleton College,
where I studied mathematics and computer science.
My academic interests also include linguistics, and I really enjoy
the intersection between these three areas, in particular the encoding,
modification, and expression of information through various means, from
natural language to cryptography.</p>

<p>I am an avid Linux user and a proponent of open-source software and
first-principles problem solving. My language of choice is C, but I work
frequently with Python and bash, I have worked extensively in the past with
Rust, and I really enjoy using functional languages whenever the opportunity
arises.</p>

<p>I am passionate about classical music. I am a clarinetist and
pianist and an alumn of the Greater Twin Cities Youth Symphonies
(<a href=https://www.gtcys.org>GTCYS</a>).</p>

<p>You can reach me through various media.</p>
