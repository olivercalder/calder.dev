<h2>Serverless Rust Unikernel</h2>
<h3>Summer 2020, Winter 2021. Advised by Aaron Bauer, Department of Computer Science, Carleton College.</h3>

I wrote a unikernel in Rust, designed to carry out a single task in a serverless environment.
Initially, I benchmarked a "hello world" task against Docker, a Linux VM, and a process, and the unikernel kernel scaled much better than either Docker or a VM, only falling short of the process at extremely high throughput.

The source code for the unikernel can be found at
<a href=https://github.com/olivercalder/rust-kernel>https://github.com/olivercalder/rust-kernel</a>.

The scripts used in benchmarking the unikernel, as well as details on the methodology and results, can be found at
<a href=https://github.com/olivercalder/kernel-benchmark>https://github.com/olivercalder/kernel-benchmark</a>.

Later, I implemented a standalone png thumbnail generator titled rusty-nail as a sample serverless workload for the unikernel, and then moved it into a standalone program which can be invoked directly or integrated into a VM, Docker/Podman, or other systems.
The kernel benchmarks were adapted to use the thumbnail generator, and the results are available in that repository.

<h2>Character Text Pipeline:</h2>
<h3>Winter 2019. Advised by Eric Alexander, Department of Computer Science, Carleton College.</h3>


This is an extension of the work from the Sonic Signatures project, built to process texts from the EEBO-TCP project.
This allows researchers to extract and clean the speech of individual characters from large xml files, and organize these characters' speech into a format which can be easily translated and analyzed, such as by the scripts from the Sonic Signatures project.

Source code and a more verbose (and up-to-date) description can be found at

<h2>Sonic Signatures:</h2>
<h3>Summer 2019. Advised by Eric Alexander, Department of Computer Science, Carleton College.</h3>

A machine learning and data visualization toolkit written to analyze phonological patterns in the speech of characters from Shakespeare's plays.
